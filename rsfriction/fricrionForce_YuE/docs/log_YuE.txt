2) frictionForce_LieOperatorsApproach.py code (fFLOA) writing and debugging continued.

What was done during 07/27/2017:

1) The study of the criteria for eletron magnetization for code fFLOA:
      For each electrons during interaction more than 100 Larmour turns! OK!
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Some problems with Python (creating matrix inside function);
      b) Something wrong with electron trajectory

What was done during 07/28/2017:

1) The study some new issues of Python.
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Ok with trajectories;
      b) Prepering of the next step - friction force calculation.
