What was done during 07/27/2017:

1) The study of the criteria for eletron magnetization for code fFLOA:
      For each electrons during interaction more than 100 Larmour turns! OK!
2) Code fFLOA writing and debugging continued:
      a) Some problems with Python (creating matrix insude function);
      b) Something wrong with electron trajectory
